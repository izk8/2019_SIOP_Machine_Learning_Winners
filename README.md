# Data and Code for the 2019 SIOP Machine Learning Competition

### Overview ###
* [Competition Overview and Awards Presentation](00_Git/2019_SIOP_Machine_Learning_Winners/2019_SIOP_ML_Competition_Pres.pdf) 

### Objective ###
* Predict self-report personality traits from open-ended text of 5 SJIs.   

### Data ###
* Data was especially created and collected for this compeition. 
* Predictors. Predictors are text responses to five open-ended situational judgment items (SJIs) designed to elicit trait-relevant behaviors. Exact question text in the ([full_data readme](https://github.com/izk8/2019_SIOP_Machine_Learning_Winners/tree/master/full_data))
* Critera. The criteria are aggregate trait scores on a Big Five personality inventory (link to items?)
* Data splits. During the competition there were three splits: training set (n = 1088), dev set (n = 300), and testing set (n = 300).

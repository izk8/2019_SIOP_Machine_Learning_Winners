Our solution is Ensemble model (i.e., weighted average on ridge regressions) from

     ###  Uni & Bi-gram Bag-of-Words  + Doc2Vec  ###
The code is clean and has been tested; make sure all the related packages/modules were installed correctly if you want to run the code. As the seed was not pre-determined, the exact same results cannot be reached repeatedly. However, the differences should be little that can be ignored.

If you have any questions regarding the codes or our solution, feel free to contact Feng Guo (fguo@bgsu.edu) For more information on this and related projects, please contact Dr. Sam McAbee (smcabee@bgsu.edu)
